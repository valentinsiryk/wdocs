**X-Pack** (security, alerting, monitoring, reporting, and graph capabilities into one easy-to-install package)


Installation
------------
   
.. note::
   
    Full newer instruction here - https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/current/installing-xpack.html
    

On host with Elasticsearch and Kibana run next commands::

    # install X-Pack plugin for Elasticsearch
    sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-plugin install x-pack --batch
    
    # restart Elasticsearch
    sudo service elasticsearch restart
    
    # install X-Pack plugin for Kibana
    sudo /usr/share/kibana/bin/kibana-plugin install x-pack
    
    # restart Kibana
    sudo service kibana restart
    
 
.. note::

    To log in to Kibana, you can use the built-in ``elastic`` user and the password ``changeme``. In Kibana WEB UI select ``Management->Users`` and change default passwords for ``elastic`` and ``kibana`` users.
    
    After changing the password for the ``kibana`` user, you will need to update ``/etc/kibana/kibana.yml``::
    
        elasticsearch.username: "kibana"
        elasticsearch.password: "<kibana_user_password>"
        
    
    And restart Kibana::
    
        sudo service kibana restart


Removing
--------   

On host with Elasticsearch and Kibana run next commands::

    # remove X-Pack plugin for Elasticsearch
    sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-plugin remove x-pack
    sudo service elasticsearch restart
    
    # remove X-Pack plugin for Kibana
    sudo /usr/share/kibana/bin/kibana-plugin remove x-pack
    sudo service kibana restart
    
    
    

Enabling and Disabling X-Pack Features
--------------------------------------

By default, all X-Pack features are enabled. You can explicitly enable or disable X-Pack features in ``elasticsearch.yml`` and ``kibana.yml``::

    # Set to false to disable X-Pack security. Configure in both elasticsearch.yml and kibana.yml.
    xpack.security.enabled
    
    # Set to false to disable X-Pack monitoring. Configure in both elasticsearch.yml and kibana.yml.
    xpack.monitoring.enabled
    
    # Set to false to disable X-Pack graph. Configure in both elasticsearch.yml and kibana.yml.
    xpack.graph.enabled
    
    # Set to false to disable Watcher. Configure in elasticsearch.yml only.
    xpack.watcher.enabled

    # Set to false to disable X-Pack reporting. Configure in kibana.yml only.
    xpack.reporting.enabled
