Resume stopped process
======================

Resume stopped process by **CTRL+Z** combination.

The general job control commands in Linux are::

	jobs                        # list the current jobs		
	fg                          # resume the job that's next in the queue		
	fg %[number]                # resume job [number]	
	bg                          # Push the next job in the queue into the background	
	bg %[number]                # Push the job [number] into the background	
	kill %[number]              # Kill the job numbered [number]
	kill -[signal] %[number]    # Send the signal [signal] to job number [number]	
	disown %[number]            # disown the process(no more terminal will be owner), so command will be alive even after closing the terminal
