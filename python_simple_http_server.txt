=======================
Python SimpleHTTPServer
=======================

::

    sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80


for python 3.x version, you may need ::

    sudo python -m http.server 80


Ports below 1024 require root privileges.

As George added in a comment, running this command as root is not a good idea - it opens up all kinds of security vulnerabilities.

However, it answers the question.
