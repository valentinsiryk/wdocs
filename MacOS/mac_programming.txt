Loop (repeat) - http://alvinalexander.com/apple/applescript-for-loop-while-loop-examples


Show all processes of application::

    tell application "Finder"
       set l to get name of every process

       repeat with i in l
            log i
       end repeat
    end tell


Pass command-line arguments to AppleScript ``osascript script.scpt hello world``. ``script.scpt``::

    on run argv
      return item 1 of argv & item 2 of argv
    end run


Debug UI elements (dirty)::

    #!/usr/bin/osascript

    tell application "Messages"
	    activate
    end tell

    tell application "System Events"
	    get properties
	    if UI elements enabled then
		    tell process "Messages"
			
			    set t1 to get every UI element
			    log t1 & "\n"
			
			    tell window "Messages"
				    set t1 to get every UI element
			        log t1 & "\n"
			        
			        tell sheet 1
			            set t1 to get every UI element
			            log "get every UI element"
			            log t1 & "\n"
			        
			            tell scroll area 1
			                set t1 to get every UI element
			                log "get every UI element"
			                log t1 & "\n"

                            tell UI element 1
                                set t1 to get every UI element
			                    log "get every UI element"
