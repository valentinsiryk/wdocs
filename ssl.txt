openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365


You can also add -nodes if you don't want to protect your private key with a passphrase, otherwise it will prompt you for "at least a 4 character" password.
The days parameter (365) you can replace with any number to affect expiration date.
It will then prompt you for things like "Country Name" but you can just hit enter and accept defaults.

Self-signed certs are not validated with any third party unless you import them to the browsers previously. If you need more security, you should use a certificate signed by a CA.
