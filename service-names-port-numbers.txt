   Reference
           [RFC6335]

   Note

 Service names and port numbers are used to distinguish between different
 services that run over transport protocols such as TCP, UDP, DCCP, and
 SCTP.

 Service names are assigned on a first-come, first-served process, as
 documented in [RFC6335].

 Port numbers are assigned in various ways, based on three ranges: System
 Ports (0-1023), User Ports (1024-49151), and the Dynamic and/or Private
 Ports (49152-65535); the difference uses of these ranges is described in
 [RFC6335]. System Ports are assigned by IETF
 process for standards-track protocols, as per [RFC6335].  User Ports
 are assigned by IANA using the "IETF Review" process, the "IESG
 Approval" process, or the "Expert Review" process, as per
 [RFC6335].  Dynamic Ports are not assigned.

 The registration procedures for service names and port numbers are
 described in [RFC6335].

 Assigned ports both System and User ports SHOULD NOT be used without
 or prior to IANA registration.
