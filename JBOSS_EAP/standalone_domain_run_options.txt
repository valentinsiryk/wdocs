															but not start other runtime services or accept end user requests.

--admin-only							Domain				Set the host controller’s running type to ADMIN_ONLY causing it to open
															administrative interfaces and accept management requests but not start servers or,
															if this host controller is the master for the domain, accept incoming connections
															from slave host controllers.

-b=<value>, -b <value>					Standalone, Domain	Set system property jboss.bind.address, which is used in configuring the bind address for
															the public interface. This defaults to 127.0.0.1 if no value is specified.

-b<interface>=<value>					Standalone, Domain	Set system property jboss.bind.address.<interface> to the given value. E.g -bmanagement=IP_ADDRESS

--backup								Domain				Keep a copy of the persistent domain configuration even if this host is not the Domain Controller.
